# Boston Street Sweeping Notifications

This app provides Street Sweeping Notifications for Boston residents and visitors. It uses data provided by the City of Boston's Open Data API, available here: https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/Street-Sweeping-Schedules/755x-x44q. It was built during an 8-hour solo hackathon at [Viking Code School](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/)

To get started, visit https://street-sweeping-bos.herokuapp.com/ and choose your street from the drop down menu.

Without signing in or signing up, you can view the street sweeping info for any street (and the stretches within that street). If you create an account, you can add streets to your account, and you will receive notifications via email the night before that stretch of street has street sweeping. 

If you don't want to create your own account, you can sign in with email: alexglach@gmail.com and password: password
